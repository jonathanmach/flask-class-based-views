# Generic REST API with Flask Class-Based Views

Using Flask Pluggable Views to create a flexible and extensible API

This is the repository used on my [Generic REST API with Flask Class-Based Views](https://jonathanmachado.me/articles/flask-generic-api-with-plugabble-views) article.

### Article summary

> Flask 0.7 introduces pluggable views inspired by the generic views from Django which are based on classes instead of functions. The main intention is that you can replace parts of the implementations and this way have customizable pluggable views.

In this article, we're exploring a potential use case for Flask Pluggable Views (aka. Class-Based Views) and its advantages over normal view functions.

The benefits of using classes might not be obvious when working on small projects, but as your application grows you may find that classes scale better than view functions.
